# Classes vs Structs in C#

This repository contains a project that shows the differences between Classes (reference types) and Structs (value types). It shows how changes can be done when passed to methods using certain keywords and using a particular way..

Program.cs: Contains the `Main` method and shows class and struct behavior.
SeperateClass.cs: Created the `SeperateClass` and a method to change its `Name`.
**SeperateStruct.cs: Created the `SeperateStruct` and a method to change its `Name` (with `ref`).
